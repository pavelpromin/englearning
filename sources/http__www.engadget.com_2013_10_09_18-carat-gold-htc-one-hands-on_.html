<p>It turns out that 18 carat gold is slightly too soft to be a sensible material for smartphones. We've been hands-on with one of just five <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/08/htc-to-offer-five-genuine-gold-one-smartphones-for-2-750-apiece/?ncid=rss_truncated">MOBO-branded gold HTC Ones</a>, which are evidently a lot less subtle than the gold iPhone 5s (shown on the right). While the exclusive $4,500 handset definitely wasn't as heavy as we were expecting, its delicate surface had already suffered a multitude of tiny scratches by the time we picked it up -- and that's despite a special protective coating that doesn't seem to be helping much. Meanwhile, our regular aluminum HTC One (on the left) still looks as good as the day it was born.</p><div class="post-gallery" score="25.75">

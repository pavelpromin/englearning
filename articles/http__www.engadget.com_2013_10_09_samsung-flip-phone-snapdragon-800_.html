<p>Samsung's recent foray into flip-phones with the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/08/14/samsung-hennessy-official-dual-screen-flip-phone/">Hennessy</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/08/21/samsung-galaxy-golden-flipphone/">Golden</a> is no joke, judging by a new model leaked from China's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/TENAA/">Tenaa</a> certification body. The SM-W2014 features the latest Snapdragon 800 processor and an ample 2GB of RAM to go along with its dual 3.67-inch, 800 x 480 Super AMOLED displays. There's also a 13-megapixel rear camera, 2-megapixel front camera, 802.11ac WiFi and Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. Now that you've digested all that, don't get too excited about a retro fling -- like it's sibling devices, the brassy-looking model is probably bound for China only.</p>

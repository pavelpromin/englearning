The company just paid the full hundred grand to Context Information Security's James Forshaw for discovering a defense circumvention technique.  While Microsoft wants a fix before it details the attack, it says that Forshaw deserved the full amount for being thorough -- he's describing a whole class of security threat, not just one flaw.  Us end users may never fully appreciate the finding, but it's good to know that the new OS will be that much safer.</p> \n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\n \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t", "domain": "www.engadget.com", "author": "Jon Fingas", "url": "http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/09/microsoft-pays-100000-bounty-for-windows-8-1-exploit/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/jifmvywi", "title": "Microsoft pays $100,000 bounty for discovery of Windows 8.1 exploit", "excerpt": "Microsoft said it would pay up to a $100,000 bounty to researchers who found exploits in Windows 8.1, and it's putting its money where its mouth is.
